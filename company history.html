		 <h3>Nestle history</h3>
      <p style="color:blue;text-align:center;">Our history begins in 1866, with the foundation of the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. <br>Henri Nestlé develops a breakthrough infant food in 1867, and in 1905 the company he founded merges with Anglo-Swiss, to form what is now known as the Nestlé Group. During this period cities grow and railways and steamships bring down commodity costs, spurring international trade in consumer goods.</p>
